class CustomGATv2Extractor(BaseFeaturesExtractor):
    """
    Implements a custom feature extractor using the GATv2 (Graph Attention Network v2) architecture.
    
    The CustomGATv2Extractor class inherits from BaseFeaturesExtractor and is responsible for extracting features from graph-structured observations. It uses two GATv2 convolutional layers to process the node features and edge attributes, and outputs a feature vector for each node in the graph.
    
    The constructor takes the following parameters:
    - observation_space: The observation space of the environment, which contains information about the node features and edge attributes.
    - features_dim: The desired dimensionality of the output feature vectors.
    - hidden_size: The size of the hidden layers in the GATv2 convolutions.
    - heads: The number of attention heads in the GATv2 convolutions.
    - dropout_rate: The dropout rate applied to the GATv2 convolutions.
    
    The forward method takes an observation dictionary as input, which contains the node features, edge indices, and edge attributes. It applies the two GATv2 convolutions to the input, and returns a tensor of output feature vectors, where each row corresponds to a node in the graph.
